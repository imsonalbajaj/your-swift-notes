# Concurrency

### Parallel vs Concurrent vs Serial
- Serial: Executes one task at a time, completing each before starting the next
- Concurrent is when you share computing resources between multiple blocks using context switching so that each gets fair chance for their execution
- parallelism is when you have multiple cores so that your tasks can actually run simultaneously
